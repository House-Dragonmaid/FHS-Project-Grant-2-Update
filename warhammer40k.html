    <p>Warhammer 40,000 is a miniatures wargame created by the british company Games Workshop as a spinoff of Warhammer Fantasy (later Rebooted to Warhammer Age of Sigmar but also rereleased as Warhammer the Old World). It takes place in the 41st Millennium where the Empire of Man, lead by the God-Emperor who is in the same state as Schrödinger's cat. The trillions of conscript soldiers and the million space marines have to fend off the armies of chaos, various xenos, and also their own people who have fallen to heresy. <br><br> My favorite faction in 40k is the Adeptus Mechanicus, a cult whom worshipps machines and the Omnissiah, a machine God. They also make various machines the Imperium uses.</p>
